## LeetCode Problem: Reverse Words in a String

### Problem Description

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the words. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by at least one space. Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space. The returned string should not include any leading or trailing spaces, and multiple spaces between words should be reduced to a single space.

#### Example 1:

- **Input**: `s = "the sky is blue"`
- **Output**: `"blue is sky the"`

#### Example 2:

- **Input**: `s = "  hello world  "`
- **Output**: `"world hello"`
- **Explanation**: The reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

#### Example 3:

- **Input**: `s = "a good   example"`
- **Output**: `"example good a"`
- **Explanation**: Multiple spaces between two words are reduced to a single space in the reversed string.

### Constraints

- 1 <= s.length <= 104
- `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
- There is at least one word in `s`.
